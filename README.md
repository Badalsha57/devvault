# 🛡️ DevVault

**DevVault** is a secure and centralized digital repository designed for developers. It serves as a personal "vault" to store, organize, and quickly access reusable code snippets, environment configurations, and essential development tools.

## 🚀 Overview

Every developer faces the challenge of rewriting the same utility functions or searching for that one specific config file across multiple projects. **DevVault** solves this by providing a structured home for all your technical assets.

- **Centralized:** No more searching through old projects.
- **Reusable:** Ready-to-use boilerplate for quick prototyping.
- **Documented:** Clear instructions for every script and configuration.
